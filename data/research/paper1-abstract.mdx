---

This paper describes the fractional-order transmission dynamics of the two variants of SARS-CoV-2, for delta and omicron variants are chosen. An SVIR-model is proposed with two infection classes corresponding to the Delta and Omicron variants. The equilibrium points of the model are determined, and the next-generation matrix method is utilized to compute the corresponding basic reproduction number ($R_0$). The local stability conditions of the proposed model are investigated around the equilibrium points using the eigenvalue method. The result shows the model is locally stable if ${R_0} < 1$ and unstable otherwise. The numerical L1 scheme is used to study the memory effect of the virus variants in the suggested model. Further, numerical simulations are provided for a better insight into the proposed model, and relevant findings are displayed graphically. The memory effect graph shows that as memory increases, there is a relative decline in infection cases of each virus variant. The result also shows early recovery in the case of the latter variant, and the intensity of the recovery relatively increases as the number of cases increases.
