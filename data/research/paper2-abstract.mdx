description: "Analysis of the Ebola fractional-order model with Caputo-Fabrizio derivative"
---

This paper uses a fractional-order epidemic model to describe the transmission dynamics of the Ebola virus. The proposed model uses the fractional-order derivative in Caputo-Fabrizio’s sense. It calculates the time-independent solutions of the proposed model, and the next-generation matrix method is used to calculate the basic reproduction number. It obtains the condition for the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the model. Further, the stability condition for generalized Ulam-Hyers-Rassias stability of the proposed model is obtained. In numerical simulations, it shows how the proposed model’s approximate solution varies for integer and fractional orders. It also shows the behavior of the Ebola infections, deceased and susceptible for various values of the contact rate. To demonstrate efficiency while using less time, CPU time is given in the tabular form.
