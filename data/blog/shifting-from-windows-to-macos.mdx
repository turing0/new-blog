I have recently purchased Apple MBA (Thanks to CSIR), Before this,  i was using old HP laptop running windows on AMD CPU. I have completely shifted (except some applications) to MacOS. Within use of just a week ( i know it's too less to judge), i have fallen in love with this new OS. 

## Clean UI

I found MacOS to be more clean and better UI than Windows (May be i was too bored of daily using windows UI and loving new changes). Obviously, in terms of personal assistance,  Siri is better than Cortana. 

## Battery Life

The biggest change i have seen is the battery life of my device, it can now go upto 2-3 days without charging. You can imagine how big shift it is as i had to keep my charger plugged in my old laptop.

## Applications

One thing that was bothering me while i was choosing MacOS was that (as windows is most commonly used) if all the daily life applications that i was using on Windows will be available here on MacOS or not ? But, most of them are ! 

### VS Code

VS Code is available free here as well, i am using it for my blog and compiling some of the TeX files using extension. Earlier, i used to have issue with contentlayer (being used for mdx content of blog) within local project on old windows, but that's not here!

### MS office

There is no problem installing MS Office here. One problem, i was using MathType add-in within MS Word for writing equations, but here I found a better alternative, MacOS has inbuilt application called Pages which is being very useful for me, i’m using it now for writing my research paper. I love it's simple interface and biggest cons is it supports LaTeX equations. Further, documents can be exported to Word(if needed). One useful add-in GrindEQ utility, that i was using within MS Word to convert Word to TeX and vice versa is not available here, i have to rely on Pandoc which (i think) is not much efficient if document involves many figures and tables. If you know any better alternative, please feel free to let me know!

### LaTeX

Similiar to windows, here too installing LaTeX is free and easy. I am here using MacTeX and Texifier (previously TeXPad) and can compile my TeX code in VSCode as well with extension. Earlier, i was using TeXStudio and MikTeX. No problems here, all earlier projects are compiling without any errors.

### MATLAB

I use Matlab for numerical simulations within my research articles. It is available here and i don't find any problem installing it here.

## Stability & Performance

I found macOS to be more stable and better performing than Windows, usually applications don't crash and open faster unlike in windows. Further, i think these are not easily infected from malwares and viruses (possibly as most users are running Windows so are vulnerable targets for hackers).

### No annoying updates

The worst thing (imo) about MS Windows is it's updates, they don't ask (no option to disable), updates in background, and annoying reboots to install updates. No such thing here!

## What i don't like

There are few things as well that i don't like in MacOS -

- Customization (Not too much customization unlike windows)
- Soldered Memory and SSD (No upgrades to RAM and internal storage, have to rely on external drives)
- Connection to Android (Only Apple Ecosystem)

## Conclusion

I am still exploring my new OS and have only noticed these to share. I’ll update it further. I know it's a bit expensive as compared to windows. But, it’s worth every penny for me. If you are in web developement, research and academics like me and don't prefer heavy gaming, I think you’ll love it too.
